# 2D-Game
The first programming project I made in my first year of university

I designed and implemented a 2-D game, “falling game”, where a key-board controlled player had to avoid two types of obstacles, using Java as programming language and processing as development tool. I used different coding concepts, such as the use of multiple classes, methods and functions, array and array list, inheritance and polymorphism.

The Main folder contains all the classe plus a data folder which includes all the images used in the project and two application folders which contain an executable that run the game.
